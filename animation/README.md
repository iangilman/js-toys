# Adding modules

This project is set up so it's easy to add new modules. To do so:

1. Pick a name for your new module. It should be alphanumeric only; no spaces or symbols. For this example we'll use "foo".
1. In the js/modules folder, make a copy of empty.js and give it your module name (e.g. foo.js).
1. Replace MODULE_NAME_GOES_HERE with your module name (e.g. foo).
1. Add a new line for your module in js/directory.js.
1. Add some code to the functions in your module.
1. Open index.html in your browser and use the menu in the upper-left of the page to select your module for viewing.

Once you have a module in a state you like, send me a pull request, or email the code to ian@iangilman.com, and I'll add it to this repository!
